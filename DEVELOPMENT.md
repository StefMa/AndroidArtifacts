# AndroidArtifacts Development

## Plugins
This projects provides two plugins.
The `guru.stefma.androidartifacts` and the `guru.stefma.javaartifacts` plugin.

Both plugins share the same API. The `ArtifactsExtension`.
Beside of this I want to make sure that each generated `Task` should be
named and behave similar in each plugin.

### AndroidArtifacts Plugin
#### Tasks
The following tasks are available for a default Android library with a `release` and a `debug` build type:
* androidArtifactDebug
* androidArtifactDebugJavadoc
* androidArtifactDebugSources
* androidArtifactRelease
* androidArtifactReleaseJavadoc
* androidArtifactReleaseSources

If you library provides more than these two **default** build types more tasks 
with the respective build type name will be created.

If the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` plugin is applied there will be also a `androidArtifactDebugKdoc` and `androidArtifactReleaseKdoc` task.

#### Tasks output
The output for the `androidArtifact{$libraryVariant}` is expected at `$project/build/generated/outputs/aar/$projectName-$variantName.aar`.
This is the default output path for the `assemble{$libraryVariant}` task which is generated by the Android Gradle Plugin.

The `*Javadoc`, `*Sources` and `*Kdoc` task output will be created inside the `$project/build/libs/$projectName-$version-$type.jar` 
(while `$type` is either `javadocs`, `sources` or `kdoc`).

The published aar and jar's can be then found in your local maven. 
Typically this is located at `~/.m2/repository/`.

#### Dependencies and POM generation
Currently we only support the following dependency configurations: 
* `api`
* `implementation`
* `compileOnly`
* `runtimeOnly`

All other configurations will be ignored and **not** added to the POM.

### JavaArtifacts Plugin
#### Tasks
This plugin will create exactly the same tasks like the `guru.stefma.androidartifacts` plugin 
but with the suffix `java` instead of the build type (e.g. `release`).

This leads to the following available tasks:
* androidArtifactJava
* androidArtifactJavaJavadoc
* androidArtifactJavaSources

If the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm` plugin is applied there will be also a `androidArtifactJavaKdoc` task.

#### Tasks output
All of the generated jar's can be found inside the `$project/build/libs/$projectName-$version-$type.jar` directory.

### Tasks
One task which is available across these plugins is the `androidArtifactGeneratedPublications` task.
This will display **all generated publication** names.

This is quite useful if you want to find out *which* publication you want to use for different actions.
Like publishing it to Bintray or Artifactory.

## Publishing docs
This plugin has a setup to publish it's **Dokka** and [**Gradle Site**](https://github.com/gradle-guides/gradle-site-plugin) to [now.sh](https://now.sh).

### Manually publishing
To publish the Dokka and the Gradle Site just run the `publishDocsToNow` task.
This will publish each of them to now. Implied that the now-cli is installed on the host.

### Publishing via CI
The CI is configured to publish both sites automatically.

It will publish both documentations to a "now staging" domain (something like **now-kasklkasd.now.sh**) on 
"all branches" expect **master** and expect all pushed **tags**.

The CI will publish it to [androidartifacts.now.sh](androidartifacts.now.sh) when a branch got merged
into the **master** branch or when we **tag **was pushed.

## Consumer
For testing purpose (or for quick examples) there are some "consumers" inside this project.
You can check them out in [`subprojects/consumer`](subprojects/consumer).
