# AndroidArtifacts

A super easy way to create Android and Java artifacts.

## Description
This is a simple helper for configure the `maven-publish` plugin. It will automatically setup the `publications` for your project.

## How to use it
You can use it as a standalone plugin in the following way:
Put these lines into your **project** `build.gradle`
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'guru.stefma.androidartifacts:androidartifacts:0.0.1'
    }
}
```

Then put these into your **module** `build.gradle`:
```groovy
apply plugin: 'guru.stefma.androidartifacts' // Add this after your android or java plugin!

androidArtifacts {
    groupId = 'com.example'
    artifactId = 'androidartifacts'
    publishVersion = '0.1'
}
```
